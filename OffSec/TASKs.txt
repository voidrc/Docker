OffSec-21 Linux CTF
==================

Rules:
- All valid flags follow the pattern: school-21{...} (with variations in capitalization)
- Flags may be encoded (base64, hex, rot13, etc.)
- Submit flags in their decoded, original format
- 9 real flags total


[01] navigation
---------------
Some paths are deeper than they look.
The filesystem is a tree, not a list.
If you feel lost, ask where you are first.

Hint: Directories can have unusual names. Even dashes.


[02] hidden files
-----------------
Linux hides things without locking them.
Visibility is a choice, not security.
Look again, but differently.

Hint: What does 'ls' not show by default?


[03] groups
-----------
You are not alone on this system.
Membership grants quiet privileges.
The system already knows who you belong to.

Hint: Check your groups, then search for files you can read.


[04] sudo
---------
Power is granted per command.
Root is not always required.
Check what you are trusted to run.

Hint: sudo -l shows your privileges. Use them wisely.


[05] cron
---------
Some actions happen when nobody is watching.
Automation leaves footprints.
Time is part of the attack surface.

Hint: /etc/cron.d holds scheduled tasks(flag). Where do they drop files?


[06] services
-------------
Not everything listens on the outside.
Localhost is still a network.
If something is open, try talking to it.

Hint: netstat or ss shows listening ports. nc can connect to them.
The flag is encoded in base64.


[07] logs
---------
Systems remember their mistakes.
Logs tell stories after the fact.
Search beats scrolling.

Hint: /var/log is full of stories. This flag uses ROT13 encoding.


[08] PATH
---------
Commands are found by order, not magic.
Names can lie.
The system trusts what it finds first.

Hint: Your shell checks directories in order. What if a common command is hijacked?


[09] symlinks
-------------
Links are not the files they point to.
Permissions can be misleading.
Follow the path, not the appearance.

Hint: Symlinks can point to privileged locations. This flag is hex encoded.


Decoding Reference
------------------
Base64: echo "encoded_string" | base64 -d
Hex: echo "hex_string" | xxd -r -p
ROT13: echo "encoded_string" | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'


Final note
----------
Think critically about each challenge.
Linux security is built on understanding, not guessing.
Good luck!
