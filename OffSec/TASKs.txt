OffSec-21 Linux CTF
==================

Rules:
- Not every FLAG{...} you see is valid.
- Think. Verify. Then submit.

Hints unlock understanding, not answers.


[01] navigation
---------------
Some paths are deeper than they look.
The filesystem is a tree, not a list.
If you feel lost, ask where you are first.


[02] hidden files
-----------------
Linux hides things without locking them.
Visibility is a choice, not security.
Look again, but differently.


[03] groups
-----------
You are not alone on this system.
Membership grants quiet privileges.
The system already knows who you belong to.


[04] sudo
---------
Power is granted per command.
Root is not always required.
Check what you are trusted to run.


[05] cron
---------
Some actions happen when nobody is watching.
Automation leaves footprints.
Time is part of the attack surface.


[06] services
-------------
Not everything listens on the outside.
Localhost is still a network.
If something is open, try talking to it.


[07] logs
---------
Systems remember their mistakes.
Logs tell stories after the fact.
Search beats scrolling.


[08] PATH
---------
Commands are found by order, not magic.
Names can lie.
The system trusts what it finds first.


[9] symlinks
-------------
Links are not the files they point to.
Permissions can be misleading.
Follow the path, not the appearance.


Final note
----------
If a flag feels too easy, it probably is.
Linux rarely gives rewards without context.
Curiosity is good. Assumptions are expensive.
